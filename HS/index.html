        <h1>Visual Surveilliance System</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In this study I was focused to develop methodology to minimize the criminal activities done by intruder and theives using 
            visual monitoring and intruder detection. A visual surveillance system is a measurement that we can take to protect vital 
            assets these devices can be integrated with the HAR system to detect suspicious activities. Some organizations and other 
            industrial firms use these devices to provide a high level of security service to protect their vital assets also these 
            systems are highly reliable and cost-effective. Also, we need to focus on the device protection. Market available visual 
            surveillance system not provide automated solutions. Also, as we know IoT and AI are modern technologies which involve in 
            many fields to address many solutions. This study will be explored a brief intro to application of modern technologies and 
            innovations using AI and implementation of SMART device. There are many embedded solutions are available in the industry for
            many problems. Embedded system engineering is widely expanded field which focused to develop advanced solution for modern day 
            problems. IoT is one of the branches in this area hence it is really important to learn and study about this. A specialize computer 
            system working on dedicated function or task can identified as embedded system, this specializes computer system has own internal 
            peripheral modules rather than external peripheral modules.In normal surveillance system only provide the monitoring and storing 
            the data but that might not be enough to address modern problems therefore from this study, focused to implement a visual surveillance 
            system with intruder detection to minimize the crimes due to intruders.Intruders have various of behaviour patterns therefore we need 
            to focus on these criteria and apply solution for this problem. As mentioned, earlier it is really important to use AI for automate 
            this process else this might not be well fitted solution to this problem. Therefore, throughout this study focused to implement 
            a solution for this problem.

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>The following steps were following to implement the methodology of this study: </p>

        </a>
        <p>The methodology of experimental model is based on the following steps: <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Step 1: Power the device via USB</li>
                <li>Step 2: Wait until the device is connected to the network and start streaming.</li>
                <li>Step 3: Configure the video streaming through the video stream server.</li>
                <li>Step 4: Run the necessary scripts for the tasks.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Use case of experimental model</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Record video footages</li>
                <li>Stream video footages</li>
                <li>Detect suspicious people (Face recognition)</li>
                <li>Protection for the property (Smart door lock)</li>
            </ol>
