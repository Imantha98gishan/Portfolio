        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> Entertainment is a vital part of our lives. It helps us to relax and enjoy our leisure time. There are many ways that
            peoples are entertained, such as watching movies, playing games, reading books, and listening to music. These activities helps
            humans to reduce stress and increase the productivity of their work. Watching movies and TV shows are one of the most popular entertainment 
            activities. It is a great way to escape from the reality and enjoy the fiction. But most of the movies and TV shows are not available free of cost and 
            it is not possible for everyone to buy them not only that it is hard to find high quality movies and TV shows with subtitles. So, in this project we are 
            focusing the develop a website to watch movies and TV shows with subtitles for free. This website will be called eflix. <br>
            This is a webapp which has a simple user interface which allows users to search for movies and TV shows.
            This webapp has introduction an descriptions of the each movie with a trailer. Also this webapp has list of
            trending movies and tv-shows and also, list of top-rated movies and tv-shows. Hence minimalistic user interface this 
            allows interact with the webapp easily not only that this webapp will be provide subtitle with many languages. <br> This web app is mainly powered by the API of the TMDB and vidsrc.me API. 
            Also, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the development of this web app. Frameworks I used are react, redux, vuejs, 
            tailwindcss
